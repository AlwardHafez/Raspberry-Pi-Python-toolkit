# Raspberry-Pi-Python-toolkit

Welcome to this repository, designed to help you create and innovate with Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
This collection of Python and Arduino codes provides a range of tools and examples, from serial communication to Wi-Fi management scripts. Whether you’re just starting or an experienced maker, you’ll find something useful here.


## **Repository Codes**

### **1. Python Codes**

- **`force_wifi_reconnect.py`**  
  Automatically reconnects your Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi if it gets disconnected. Ideal for maintaining connectivity in IoT projects.
  
- **`send data to arduino manually.py`**  
  Enables seamless communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino using serial ports. A great starting point for projects requiring data exchange between the two platforms.

### **2. Arduino Codes**
- **`Arduino Code`**  
  A template for handling serial commands sent from a Raspberry Pi or any other device. Customizable for up to five commands.
